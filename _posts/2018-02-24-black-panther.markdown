I saw Black Panther yesterday. Finally, a film where the antagonist is as understandably driven as the protagonist. 
Superhero movies often contain origin stories, but rarely do the villains come from anywhere but the most warped frames of mind,
pushed to the very brink of reality. This story shows two men looking to continue their fathers' legacies, fix their fathers' mistakes, 
and create a new world order to justify their fathers' untimely deaths. There is hardly a moment when I don't understand the actions of N'Jadaka. You could hardly even call his actions wrong until he takes the throne and sets to throw the whole world into disarray and disorder 
with powerfull warfare. Then he starts to destroy the traditions and stability of Wakanda. But until his ascension on the throne, I hardly even 
want T'Challa to stop him.
